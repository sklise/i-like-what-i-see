# I Like What I See

![alt text](http://www.memelinks.com/like-all-the-posts.jpg "Like!")

_I Like What I See_ is a Chrome extension to automatically click all "Like"
links on Facebook. When you visit Facebook, click the thumbs up
in the extension bar and start scrolling and liking. Liking and scrolling.
Every instance of the word "Like" will be clicked. Don't worry, Facebook is
a fun place full of all of the stuff you like.

If you scroll too fast Facebook might find it impossible that you like all
of the things you do as fast as you do (seeing is believing/liking). You
may find yourself being blocked from expressing your true feelings for your
friends status updates.

## Installation

This extension probably violates some terms of service with Facebook and so
I will not be submitting it to the Chrome Web Store.

1. Download the zip of this extension: https://github.com/sklise/i-like-what-i-see/releases
2. Open up the Extensions page in Chrome. chrome://extensions/
3. Check the box marked "Developer Mode"
4. Click the "Load unpacked extension" button and select the folder you just unzipped.
5. An icon should appear in the Chrome Toolbar.
